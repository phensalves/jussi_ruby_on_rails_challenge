Her powers were unremarkable compared to the amazing abilities of the costumed icons that populate the Marvel Universe. In a city of Marvels, Jessica Jones never found her niche. Now a chain-smoking, self-destructive alcoholic with a mean inferiority complex, Jones is the owner and sole employee of Alias Investigations - a small, private-investigative firm specializing in super-human cases. In her inaugural arc, Jessica's life immediately becomes expendable when she uncovers the potentially explosive secret of one hero's true identity. But her wit, charm and intelligence just may help her survive through another day. Thrust into the midst of a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels, has Jessica burned too many bridges to turn to old friends for help? Plus: Jessica travels to upstate New York to investigate the disappearance of a teenage girl rumored to be a mutant in a prejudiced small town, goes on a date with the Astonishing Ant-Man, teams up with Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman; and confronts the demons of her past!

Backed up by weird tales of wax museums, witchcraft, Martians, and the occult master who set the trenchcoat trend in comics, Dr. Druid, it seemed these titanic tales could never be topped.\r<br>\r<br>And then Stan Lee and Steve Ditko did just that by launching "The Magazine That Respects Your Intelligence!" An all-new approach for the young comics sophisticate, Amazing Adult Fantasy presented Twilight Zone-tinged tales of otherworldly aliens, time travel, ghosts, atomic nightmares, and maybe even the secret of the universe itself. With story after lushly-illustrated story, Ditko set a new standard for comic book illustration, and Lee raised the bar ever higher with his scintillating scripts. And, oh, in the last issue they created some guy named "Spider-Man." \r<br>\r<br>Collecting this lynchpin series of Marvel Comics' history for the first time ever, the Amazing Fantasy Omnibus puts AMAZING ADVENTURES #1-6, AMAZING ADULT FANTASY #7-14 and AMAZING FANTASY #15 between two hardcovers 45 years in the making.\r<br>\r<br>416 PGS./All Ages ...$74.99 \r<br>\r<br>ISBN: 0-7851-2458-6 \r<br>	2018-02-04 22:39:07.527012	2018-02-04 22:39:07.527012

Every man, woman and child, eliminated with the cold precision of a machine. And out of the flaming remnants of this tiny Baltic state comes a message from its murderer: Mankind's days are numbered...because Ultron has returned! He - or it - is one of the Avengers' oldest, most implacable foes, menacing humanity countless times. But never before has Ultron been this dangerous, this deadly. Now, he stands on the brink of committing global genocide, and rebuilding Earth in his own robotic image. Our only hope is a desperate U.N. strike on Slorenia, led by the Avengers themselves. But will it be in time? Will the strength and courage of Earth's Mightiest Heroes be enough in the face of such overwhelming evil? For the sake of the world, it will have to be! Plus: When you're an Avenger, you're one of Earth's Mightiest Heroes - the first line of defense against the dangers no conventional foe could halt, the threats no ordinary man could withstand.

In their latest, greatest Marvel Masterworks, the Fantastic Four confront one of their oldest enemies - the Skrulls! And they'll have to do it as their older selves, after an aging weapon advances them to death's door! The talents of Marv Wolfman, Keith Pollard and John Byrne - in his FF debut - keep the story feisty, the art spry and the adventure fantastic. How could it not be when the world-devourer Galactus enters the fray with a new herald? As if that weren't enough, the cosmic Sphinx, scheming Monocle, combustible Blastaar, formidable Frightful Four and diabolical Salem's Seven keep the scope epic, the stakes absolute, and you on the edge of your seat! And H.E.R.B.I.E.? He's just keeping it real.	2018-02-05 01:38:25.911971	2018-02-05 01:38:25.911971

With those words, Misty Knight enlists streetwise vigilantes to tackle the jobs no other super-team will. When she calls, people listen - including Falcon, Black Widow, Ghost Rider, Silver Sable, Moon Knight and Paladin! But while Misty takes control, the Puppet Master might be pulling strings of his own. Can Iron Fist and the Punisher help her uncover the truth?
